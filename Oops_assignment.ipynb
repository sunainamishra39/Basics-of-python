        "\n",
        "* Abstraction is about hiding complexity and showing only the essential features. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. Think of driving a car: you interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift (the essential features), without needing to know the intricate details of how the engine works.\n",

It's also about controlling access to that data, preventing direct modification from outside the object and ensuring that data is accessed and modified only through the object's defined methods. This protects the data's integrity and allows for easier maintenance and modification of the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Think of it like real-world inheritance. A child inherits certain traits from their parents. Similarly, in OOP, a child class inherits the characteristics of its parent class.

        "* In Python, encapsulation is achieved primarily through conventions rather than strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected found in some other object-oriented languages (like Java or C++). Python has a concept of \"name mangling\" which provides a limited form of protection for attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Here's how encapsulation is typically achieved in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bundling data and methods: You define attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on the data) within a class. This bundles related data and behavior together into a single unit, which is the object.\n",
        "* **Using conventions for \"protected\" members:** By convention, attributes and methods that are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses are prefixed with a single underscore (_). This is a signal to other developers that these members should not be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. However, this is just a convention, and you can still access them if you choose to.\n",
        "* **Using name mangling for \"private\" members:** For attributes and methods that are intended to be more strongly \"private\" and not easily accessible from outside the class, you can prefix them with a double underscore (__). This triggers Python's name mangling mechanism. The attribute name is internally changed to _ClassName__attribute_name. This makes it harder to access them directly from outside the class, but it's not impossible.\n",
        "* **Providing public methods for controlled access:** To interact with the object's data, you provide public methods (without underscores) that control how the data is accessed and modified. This allows you to add validation or other logic before modifying the data, ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "* In summary, while Python doesn't have strict access modifiers, encapsulation is achieved through a combination of:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bundling data and methods within classes.\n",
        "Using naming conventions (single underscore) to indicate intended internal use.\n",
        "Using name mangling (double underscore) for a stronger form of \"privacy.\"\n",
        "Providing public methods to control access and modification of data.\n",
        "This approach emphasizes the idea that encapsulation is more about design and how you structure your code and communicate your intentions to other developers, rather than relying solely on language-enforced restrictions."

If you add a new Pentagon class with a draw() method, your existing drawing loop will work with it automatically.\n",

This modularity makes the code easier to understand, develop, and debug. You can work on individual objects or modules without affecting others.\n",

        "* **Maintainability:** OOP code is generally easier to maintain. Because objects are self-contained, you can modify the internal implementation of an object without affecting the rest of the program, as long as the object's interface (its public methods) remains consistent. This makes it easier to fix bugs and add new features.\n",
        "* **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes that share a common interface. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend. You can add new classes and functionality without significant modifications to existing code.\n",
        "* **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the essential features of an object. This simplifies the view of the system and makes it easier for developers to work with objects without getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty details.\n",
        "* **Improved Collaboration:** The modular nature of OOP makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Developers can work on different objects or modules independently and then integrate them.\n",
        "* **Better Organization:** OOP provides a structured way to organize code using classes and objects, which can map well to real-world concepts. This can make the codebase more intuitive and easier to navigate.\n",
        "* **Easier Troubleshooting:** Due to encapsulation and modularity, it's often easier to pinpoint the source of an issue in an OOP program. You can isolate the problem within a specific object or module.\n",
        "While OOP has many advantages, it's not a silver bullet and may not be the best fit for all types of projects. However, for large, complex, and long-lived software systems, the benefits of OOP in terms of organization, reusability, and maintainability are often significant."

        "\n",
        "The `super()` function in Python is used to refer to the parent class (or a sibling class in multiple inheritance) of the class it is called from. Its primary significance lies in facilitating inheritance, particularly when dealing with method overriding and accessing methods or attributes of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main purposes and significance of `super()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Calling Parent Class Methods:** The most common use of `super()` is to call a method from the parent class that has been overridden in the current subclass. This allows the subclass to extend or modify the parent's behavior rather than completely replacing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Accessing Parent Class Attributes:** While less common, `super()` can also be used to access attributes (including class variables) of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Working with Multiple Inheritance:** In scenarios with multiple inheritance, `super()` follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which parent class's method to call. This helps in coordinating calls to methods across the inheritance hierarchy, especially when parent classes have methods with the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Maintaining Code Readability and Maintainability:** Using `super()` makes your code more readable and maintainable, especially when dealing with complex inheritance structures. It explicitly indicates that you are referring to a parent class's implementation, making the code's intent clearer. It also makes your code more robust to changes in the parent class's name or the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Initializing Parent Classes:** A very common use case is in the `__init__` method of a subclass. You use `super().__init__(...)` to call the constructor of the parent class, ensuring that the parent class's attributes are properly initialized before the subclass initializes its own attributes.\n",

Python's garbage collector runs periodically, and the order in which objects are garbage collected can be unpredictable. This means you cannot rely on `__del__` being called immediately after the last reference to an object is removed, or in a specific order relative to other objects.\n",
        "*   **Circular References:** Circular references between objects can prevent them from being garbage collected, and thus `__del__` might never be called for those objects.\n",
        "*   **Exceptions in `__del__`:** If an exception occurs within the `__del__` method, it is ignored by Python, but a warning is printed. This can make debugging difficult.\n",
        "*   **Not a Replacement for Context Managers (`with` statement):** For resource management tasks (like files or network connections), using context managers (`with` statement) is generally preferred over `__del__`. Context managers provide a more deterministic and reliable way to acquire and release resources.\n",
